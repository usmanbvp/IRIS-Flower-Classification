## About the Project

The Iris Flower Classification project is a classic example of a machine learning classification task. It involves predicting the species of Iris flowers based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### Built With

- Python
- Scikit-Learn
- Flask (for web application)

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your system. If you haven't already, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/usmanbvp/iris-flower-classification.git``````
2. Change directory:

  ```cd iris-flower-classification```
3. Install the required packages:
  ```pip install -r requirments.txt```
   The `requirements.txt` file contains a list of necessary packages and their versions.
  
### Usage
1. Run the web appilcation:
    ```python app.py```
2. Open your web browser and got to http://localhost:5000.

3. Use the web interface to input sepal and petal measurements to classify iris flowers.

### Deployment
When you are finished running it on your local machine, you should host your project online. We highly recommend deploying on PythonAnywhere for practice because it's free to use.
