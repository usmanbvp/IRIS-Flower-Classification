# IRIS-Flower-Classification
Iris Flower Classification
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into their respective species using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Dataset Description
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of the Iris flower, which can be one of three possible values: setosa, versicolor, or virginica.

Project Structure:

The project is structured as follows:

iris.csv: The dataset used in this project.
iris_classification.ipynb: A Jupyter notebook that contains the code for data exploration, data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
requirements.txt: A file that lists all the required dependencies to run the code in the Jupyter notebook.
